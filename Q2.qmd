## Exercise 2

A small cafe in the city of Melbourne is interested in determining whether the daily earnings depend on the weather. They compiled data for a period over 2000-2001 to study this question. Their data is provided. It has the following variables:

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(kableExtra)
desc <- tibble(var=c("dt", "wday", "revenue", "expend", "precip", "mint", "maxt", "source"),
               description=c("Date", 
              "Day of the week",
              "Daily revenue in hundreds, 11=1100", 
              "Daily expenses in hundreds",
              "Precipitation in mm", 
              "Minimum temperature, Celsius",
              "Maximum temperature, Celsius",
              "Source of the weather data"))
kbl(desc, table.attr = 'data-quarto-disable-processing="true"') |> 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) |>
  column_spec(1, width="2cm", border_right = T) |>
  column_spec(2, width="10cm")
```

You need to conduct an **initial data analysis** to find and **report problems** that need to be fixed.
