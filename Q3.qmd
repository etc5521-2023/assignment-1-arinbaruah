# Filter relevant data

In this section, we will filter our data in a manner such that we can focus on the sightings of Numbats across Australia from the years after 2010.

```{r}
df_numbats <- df_numbats %>% filter(year(eventDate) > 2010 )
```

# Count of daily sightings

The number of Numbat sightings for each event date are calculated through the code chunk below.

```{r}
df_numbats_daily <- df_numbats %>% group_by(eventDate) %>% summarise(daily_sightings = n())
```


# Visualisation of daily sightings

Let us now visualise this data through a histogram as illustrated by @fig-hist

```{r}
#| label: fig-hist
#| fig-cap: "Histogram of daily sights of Numbats across Australia"

pl1 <- ggplot(data = df_numbats_daily,aes(x = daily_sightings)) + geom_histogram(fill = 'cornsilk',color = 'black') + labs(x = "Number of sightings per day",y = "Frequency of observations") + theme_classic()
pl1
```
<div class="alert alert-block alert-success">
ðŸ’¡ We can observe that majority of the daily sightings are around one per day. The distribution is right skewed with very daily sightings above 5 per day. ðŸ’¡ </div>

While @fig-hist helped us visualise the data, we can obtain a similar distribution of the data using [stem and leaf plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem-and-leaf_display). Let us create this visualisation using the stem function in R.

```{r}
stem(df_numbats_daily$daily_sightings)
```

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
ðŸ’¡ As we can observe through the above visualisation, the stem and leaf plot illustrates a very similar understanding of the distribution of the data as the histogram plot. The stem leaf plot was able to capture the fact that majority of the observations were below 5 sightings per day and <strong> a right skew in the data </strong> could be observed. ðŸ’¡ </div>


# Five number summaries based on Tukey's EDA

Tukey's EDA is based on the following 5 number summaries:

- Minimum value 
- Lower hinge 
- Median value  
- Upper hinge
- Maximum value

```{r}
#| label: tbl-fivnum
#| tbl-cap: "Five number summary based on Tukey's EDA" 

table1 <- tibble()
table1 <- tibble("Minimum value" = min(df_numbats_daily$daily_sightings),
                "Lower hinge" = quantile(df_numbats_daily$daily_sightings,0.25),
                "Median" = median(df_numbats_daily$daily_sightings),
                "Upper hinge" = quantile(df_numbats_daily$daily_sightings,0.75),
                "Maximum" = max(df_numbats_daily$daily_sightings))
table1 %>% kable()
```

@tbl-fivnum illustrates the five number summaries for the daily sightings of Numbats around Australia.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-success">
ðŸ’¡ The lower and upper hinge in Tukey's EDA correspond to the <b> 1st quartile (25th percentile) and 3rd quartile (75th percentile) </b> observations respectively. ðŸ’¡ </div>

# Step, Inner and Outer fence calculation

Based on [Tukey's EDA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1332871/), following are the salient definitions:

1. __Step__: Step is dependent on the Inter Quartile Range (IQR) and is calculated as __1.5 times the IQR__.
2. __Inner Fence__: 1 step outside the hinges (Q1 or Q3). The inner fence generally classifies the __mild outliers__ just around the edge of the whiskers of the boxplot.
3. __Outer Fence__: 2 steps outside the hinges (Q1 or Q3). The outer fences generally classify the __extreme outliers__ which are considerably away from the whiskers of the boxplot.

The calculated values for the daily sightings are tabulated in @tbl-stepfence.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-stepfence
#| tbl-cap: "Calculated values of steps and fences"
table2 <- tibble("Step" = 1.5*IQR(df_numbats_daily$daily_sightings),
                "Inner fence" = quantile(df_numbats_daily$daily_sightings,0.75) + 1.5*IQR(df_numbats_daily$daily_sightings),
                "Outer fence" = quantile(df_numbats_daily$daily_sightings,0.75) + 1.5*IQR(df_numbats_daily$daily_sightings) * 2)
table2 %>% kable()
```

@fig-tukeda illustrates a boxplot based on key values calculated in @tbl-fivnum and @tbl-stepfence.

# Boxplot of daily sightings

Let us try to visualise the observations of daily sightings through a boxplot as illustrated by @fig-box

```{r}
#| label: fig-box
#| fig-cap: "Boxplot distribution of daily sightings"

pl4 <- ggplot(data = df_numbats_daily,aes(y = daily_sightings),color = 'black') + geom_boxplot() + labs(y = "Daily sightings") + theme_classic()
pl4
```

@fig-box illustrates a boxplot with the distribution of daily sightings of Numbats across Australia. We can observe a total of 4 outlier values which are illustrated as point observations in the boxplot. These are __those observations which are greater than the upper whisker__. The upper whisker is calculated as below.

$$\boxed{Upper Whisker = (1.5 * IQR) + Q3}$$
Based on the distribution of the histogram in @fig-hist and the stem plot, we can observe that the number of sightings which are above 5 per day are extremely low. This has been corroborated by the boxplot in @fig-box. As a result, we can conclude that the singular points marked in the boxplot are __reasonably marked as outliers based on the upper whisker value as calculated above__.
